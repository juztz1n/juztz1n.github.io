                <p>
                    Gamma Engine
Heavily modified version of Zed (https://github.com/juztz1n/Zed). Using the same system (component-based system) and with hopefully more features. I am currently only focusing on the rendering part of the engine until i get some good enough graphics for basic physics and creating actual games. Here are the list of features the engine has right now and what i have planned.

                <p>
                    This project is made with maven so once you have imported the maven project into your IDE you can start to do the following.

                    You'll first need to create a class that has the super class zin.gammaEngine.core.Game, once you've imported all the needed methods you'll need to go into the Main class which is located under zin.gammaEngine.core insde the engine_source source file and change the values to your liking and most importantly change the 4th parameter in the creation of the CoreEngine in the main method to create a new instance of the game class you've made. After that you can check out the already existing game class & resources such as the model files (.gmf) as reference and copy some stuff from there.

                <span>GAMMA ENGINE 3</span>
                <p>
                    This is just temporary for people who want to get a taste of what i'm shooting for and is not guaranteed to stay the same in future versions. More in-depth documentation will be added once there are enough features for making a game and a lot of the ground works have been layed.

                    Current features:
                    Basic lighting (DirectionalLight, PointLight and SpotLight)
                    Skyboxes.
                    Specular & normal mapping.
                    Parallax displacement mapping.
                    Bloom.
                    Billboards. (3D Models)
                    Very primitve audio system.
